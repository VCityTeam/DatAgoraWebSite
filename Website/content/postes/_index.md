#  Ingenier position in the DatAgora Project
  * Political, economic or social decision-making must increasingly be based on data while mobilizing an interdisciplinary approach. While the volume of data remains a challenge (large data sets), the multi-source nature is also important in finding the right data set, combining it with existing data and enriching it with domain-specific modeling and learning. The DatAgora project aims here at experimenting new modalities of interaction, understanding and decision support around data. This project is led by researchers from the University of Lyon (LabEx Aslan, LabEx IMU, Laboratoires ICAR, LIRIS, ...) in strong partnership with the metropolis of Lyon (Erasme Urban Lab, Data Service, business services, ...).
