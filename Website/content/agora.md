## Previous experimentations
Several experimentations have been done around the MAM project : [Mediation and Augmented Mock-up](https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/workshop-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/)

In the last two years, workshops have been organized in collaboration with the IMU LabEx, the Erasme Urban Lab and the Lyon Urban School). 
- [Workshop in 2019]( https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/workshop-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/) : The objective of this workshop was to bring together students to reflect on the development of participatory use scenarios on public policy issues based on a 4D model (3D + time) of open data visualization of territorial data of "Grand Lyon".
- [Workshop in 2020]( https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/formation/retour-sur-latelier-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/) : The objective was to reflect collaboratively on the way in which an architectural project (in this case, that of the Learning Center programmed on the Porte des Alpes Campus of the University Lumi√®re Lyon 2 in Bron) fits into a territory, and to propose a concrete representation of this issue, a representation that had to be based on a model of the building and its enrichments: by territorial data sets, historical documents, etc. 
- The Anthropocene Week 2021 : The Anthropocene Week is an event organised for the past two years by the Lyon Urban School, which brings together participants with very different profiles around different activities (round tables, workshops, exhibitions, etc.) regarding the impact of man on his environment.
- [Vegetalization Project](Vegetalization-Project) : This project consists in developping a 3D model of Part-Dieu, one of the most important area of Lyon, in order to interact with data and mediate about the revegetation of the city. To do so, several devices will surround the model to help display, analyze and interact with urban data. We are closely collaborating with [Erasme](https://www.erasme.org/) to carry this project out.
