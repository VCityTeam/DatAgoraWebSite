## Previous experimentations
Several experimentation have been done around the MAM project : [Mediation and Augmented Mock-up](https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/workshop-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/)

In the last two years, to workshops has been organized in collaboration with LabEx IMU, Erasme Urban Lab and Lyon Urban School). 
- [Workshop in 2019]( https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/workshop-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/) : The objective of this workshop was to bring together students to reflect on the development of participatory use scenarios on public policy issues based on a 4D model (3D + Time) of open data visualization of territorial data of "Grand Lyon".
- [ Workshop in 2020]( https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/formation/retour-sur-latelier-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/) :  The objective was to reflect in a collaborative way on the way in which an architectural project (in this case, that of the Learning Center programmed on the Porte des Alpes Campus of the University Lumi√®re Lyon 2 in Bron) fits into a territory, and to propose a concrete representation of this issue, a representation that had to be based on a model of the building and its enrichment: by territorial data sets, historical documents, etc. 
- [Vegetalization Project](Vegetalization-Project) : This project consists in the development of a 3D model of Part-Dieu, one of the most important area of Lyon, to interact with data regarding the revegetation of the city in order to mediate on the subject. To do so, several devices will also surround the model to help display, analyze and interact with urban data. We are closelly collaborating with [Erasme](https://www.erasme.org/) to carry out this project.
