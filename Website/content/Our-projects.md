* [Place of Vegetation in cities](Vegetalization-Project) : This project consists in the development of a 3D model of Part-Dieu, one of the most important area of Lyon, to interact with data regarding the revegetation of the city in order to mediate on the subject. To do so, several devices will also surround the model to help display, analyze and interact with urban data. We are closelly collaborating with Metropole de Lyon ([Erasme Urban Lab](https://www.erasme.org/), vegetation services, data services) to carry out this project.
