* **Didier CHANFRAY** :
 Through 25 years of experience in the video game industry, Didier Chanfray lived through an incredible succession of experimentations, inventions, reassessments, innovations, and revolutions turning his game designer career into a true passion. Having worked with some of the greatest companies in the industry - Sega, Electronic Arts, Activision, Atari, Ubisoft — he became a prime source for game production and creativity.
Didier Chanfray’s intent: _« Technology its permanent evolution, new applications, new usages and markets — represents an endless source of motivation for me. DatAgora Project matches perfectly with this creative and exploratory process. My intention is to propose some virtuous principles of the game, such as commitment, sharing, co-building, empathy ... From my point of view, some playful principles associated with the concept of augmented model could improve the collection of data and mediation. These are our 2 main objectives to be achieved through the implementation of this kind of device._
