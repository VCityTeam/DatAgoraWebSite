## DatAgora Principle: Knowledge and know-how to mobilise data in learning, decision support and knowledge dissemination processes.

This proposal is in analogy with the operation of FABLABs. The aim is to create places with a fairly low deployment cost in order to set up a network with common values (charters, use and production methods, openness to society, etc.). These places mobilize bricks that can be technical and scientific, which can then be duplicated and reused in future experiments. The approach is modular, collaborative and inclusive.

A Totem room, a place for experimentation and collection of works, will be set up; it will allow a permanent visibility of the system over time. The other rooms that will be equipped will be able to receive equipment that can be moved if, for example, there is a need for experimentation in another place or for a temporary event (take for example a festival such as [Pop Sciences](https://popsciences.universite-lyon.fr/le-festival/)). The rooms can be reserved and used by students, researchers, or for performances for the general public.

Within the rooms, it is necessary to set up bricks / components (usually hardware or software) that we call here "stations". For example, a station can be used to set up a screen wall, to capture exchanges between speakers, or to prepare data for use (More specific examples are given in other sections). It is thus possible to mobilize one or more stations in the framework of an experiment. Rooms can also mobilize basic stations allowing the networking of several sites, as it would be possible to do via videoconferencing systems.
