## Experimentations
DatAgora is also a place for experimenting with data. The experiments can be carried out by mobilising internal resources or through student groups supervised by the DatAgora team.
Today, several projects have been dealt with or are being examined. These projects can be thematic and/or technical.

### Vegetate cities
Summary: Part-Dieu is a central district in the cultural and economic life of Lyon. It is an important node of the city's transport network, which makes it a crucial point of interest on a European scale. In addition, it is the most important financial district in France beside Paris. Given the importance of Part-Dieu for the future development of Lyon and France, every aspect of the area, every future change, must be carefully considered and planned to ensure its prosperity.
The project is a collaboration with "Le Plan Canopé", which aims to plant over 300,000 trees by 2020 in the Lyon metropolis. Our objective is to show the effects of vegetation on the city in order to raise awareness among elected officials or citizens about the fight against urban heat islands or noise pollution, for example.

Our problematic is knowing where to plant these trees so that they are the most effective and the least restrictive. During the last six months of 2020, we collected a maximum amount of urban data that could be useful for processing and visualising the parts of the city that are most suitable for greening the Lyon metropolis, even if the first stage is to focus on the Part Dieu area.
A set of projects has been instructed in this sense.

- [Place of Vegetation in cities](Vegetalization-Project) : This project consists in the development of a 3D model of Part-Dieu, one of the most important area of Lyon, to interact with data regarding the revegetation of the city in order to mediate on the subject. To do so, several devices will also surround the model to help display, analyze and interact with urban data. We are closelly collaborating with Metropole de Lyon ([Erasme Urban Lab](https://www.erasme.org/), vegetation services, data services) to carry out this project.

- [Geonum Project](fr/geonum_20/Projet_Geonum_20) : A project by students of the UDL Geonum Master's degree which aims to provide new data layers from urban data layers to highlight the most important points that we wish to highlight, but also to produce new statistical values.

- [LabXP Projet](fr/labxp_20/Projet_Labxp_20) : This is a video game creation project by GAMAGORA students. It is a prototype of a management game which aims to manage vegetation in an urban environment. It aims to show the player the complexity of managing the establishment and maintenance of green areas in cities, taking into account several environmental parameters.  

- ECL (Dashboard) : This project, carried out by students at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, allows for the retrieval of online data as well as their processing in order to calculate various statistical indicators. It allows the restitution of this information in the form of a modular dashboard, which can include graphic elements in addition to the display of raw data.

- Canopée Remix : The Canopée Remix is an event organised by the metropolis of Lyon from 10 to 13 November 2020 and which aimed to reflect on the creation of several initiatives around vegetation in the city. More than 100 participants collaborated to propose 8 prototypes of collective action, awareness raising and teaching projects, or management and maintenance of vegetation.   

- The Anthropocene Week 2021 : The Anthropocene Week is an event organised for the past two years by the Lyon Urban School, which brings together participants with very different profiles around different activities (round tables, workshops, exhibitions, etc.) regarding the impact of man on his environment.
