The Mire module is a camera detection station based on OpenCV, that we use to track real life objects and either display them in Unity, or interact with objects in them scene. An object can be track thanks to its shape or color, depending on what best fits the user's needs. To prevent interferences from other objects in the camera field of view, the user can configure lower and upper bounds to best match the object they are tracking. The module is also capable of detecting the orientation of an object so having scene components that use rotation is also possible.
