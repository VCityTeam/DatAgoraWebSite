## Introduction
Augmented modeling uses augmented reality to display additional data on the physical model. This allows the user a better immersion but also to quickly visualize different types of data.

### CityIO (CityScope)
[CityIO](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cityio/overview/) is another [CityScope](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cityscope/overview/) experimental framework that stores its city data on a cloud computer and offers to access it through [AR (Augmented Reality)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) mapped on top of a city physical model.

CityIO can be used as a reference for the MAM-Erasme project when an AR enhancement would come to be considered.


### MAA : Fluvial mobility
This project have the goal to develop self-governing barge in Europe.

Numerous problematics :
* flow : merchandise management, interchange
* Energy : Autonomous management restocking of barges in electricity
* Network & communication : Navigation management of barges during complexe situation
* Fluid physics : Manoeuvrability (flow, wind...)

To answer at that issues there are 3 augmented models style :
1. Complexe model : Dynamic water
2. White model : Mapping
3. Virtual model

### HoloLens 2
[Hololens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/hololens/buy) is an helmet of immersive mixed reality developed by Microsoft. He is specialy use for professionals in there jobs. he utilizes mixed reality for site productivity by providing precise alignment of holographic data on the job site, enabling workers to review their models overlaid in the context of the physical environment.


### My Social Box :  Wrapper carto 3D
In order to optimize the development time, we would like to have a utility library Javascript of Wrapper type around the iTowns 3D mapping libraries and/or CesiumJS. The objective is to facilitate and accelerate the integration of these libraries by simplifying the APIs and to mount a level of abstraction. The goal is to have a library to use programmatically.This wrapper will also allow us to add a level of indirection between their applications and the 3D library used (currently "iTowns" or "CesiumJS") which will facilitate migration to another library if necessary.

### CESIR, Civil Security simulation tool

[CESIR](https://www.valabre.com/prestations/cesir) offers 3 means of simulation :
* **SEGRIC** : Risk and Disaster Management Training Simulator - 2 complete simulation sets - 8000 m² with 24 to 32 actors simultaneously - with Aircraft / Land Boxes / Classrooms / Command Post / Anticipation Room / DIREX / Crisis Room / Boat

* **SECOAS** : Emergency Air Operations Coordination Training Simulator - Set of 8 aircraft and helicopter simulation stations - 500m² of 22 actors simultaneously - with Cockpits / Planes / Helicopters / Classrooms / DIREX / Amphitheatre

* **SIMOB** : Mobile Simulator - Set of 2 to 12 stations for multi-risk management - with Multifunction Operator Stations

### Augmented reality Apple
Apple has a large Ar platform, with hundreds of millions of AR-enabled devices, as well as thousands of AR apps one the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/augmented-reality/).

* Complete Anatomy
This application give the possibility to visualize the human body in intricate detail to learn more about its every part. (Motion capture on Ipad Pro)

* IKEA Place
You can place Ikea products in your home if it fit well.(On the new iPad Pro with LiDAR Scanner)

* Hot Lava
The classic hot lava game on Apple arcade. it turn your living room into lava-filled obstacle course. You have to race your character throught the course, boucing off both real and virtual objects to complete it.
