title : "Analysis of urban mobility flows"
---

The GPS sensors of smartphones now provide a global view of the spatial and temporal mobility of a city's inhabitants. However, this opportunity remains under-exploited, despite the availability of these data made public and anonymous, as for example with OpenStreetMap. The current locks are :

* Data quality: requires their raw display, but the data being very voluminous it is necessary to have a large display space.

* Contextualization: contextualization with background maps, road maps, INSEE population data and travel-work surveys, etc.

* Modelling / Simulation: in order to test hypothetical development scenarios.

DatAgora will make it possible to tackle these three issues by networking technical skills on the Lyon - Saint-Etienne site around trajectory type data and the fusion of multi-source data, but also via the networking of expertise in fields related to mobility (scientific, political) fed by interactive visualisations, in particular from modelling hypothetical scenarios around, for example, the development of a district or transport offers.
The DatAgora room and its stations could be mobilised around this scenario in the context of festivals for the general public (e.g. Science Festival) where each citizen will be able to visualise the GPS data collected by his or her smartphone and be made aware of the tracking that applications or telephone operators operate.
