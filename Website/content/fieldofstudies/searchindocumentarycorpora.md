title : "Search in documentary corpora"
---

Another line of thought concerns data extracted from documentary corpuses or even social networks. This data is not necessarily geolocalized or the localization can be induced (a simple example is that by crossing data from social networks and the words used, it is possible to deduce the localization of an event). This example of searching in documentary corpuses finds its full meaning in the context of research conducted on the Lyon-Saint-Etienne site around the Semantic Web, data mining and in particular through the collaboration and needs of the metropolis of Lyon on this subject.
The research can also take place in bibliometric corpora, as Sebastian Grauwin proposes today at the UdL. Representations allow, for example, to visualize occurrences of keywords, links between researchers or between laboratories, ...

Examples of visualizations related to bibliometrics.

The locks identified are :
* Data Qualification - Data Correction
* Crossing modes and data representation
* Data analysis guided by a visualization context

DatAgora will, for example, enable researchers in the setting up phase of ANR or European projects to identify new complementary partners for their consortium, but also to showcase new representations of research in Lyon Saint-Etienne.
