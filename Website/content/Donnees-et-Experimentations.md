## Data and experimentations
DatAgora federates experimentations around urban data.
These experiments are carried out by researchers and engineers directly, or through supervision of groups of students.

Multiple projects have already been initiated and realized, or are being examined.
These projects are categorized in the following problematics.

### Urban revegetation
With urban areas globally increasing, more and more vegetation is encompassed by cities.
What are the effects of vegetation on cities and vice-versa?
If vegetation has been shown to help mitigate the urban heat island effect, noise and air pollution for instance, it also needs light, water and space and can have some detrimental effects.
So where and how to [re]vegetate properly?
How to communicate about urban [re]vegetation and raise awareness about this problematic among elected officials or citizens?

The following projects study [re]vegetation of urban areas, focussing on the **specific case of the *Part-Dieu* business district** of the Lyon metropolis :
- [Place of Vegetation in cities](Vegetalization-Project) :
  Development of a tangible and enriched mockup of the *Part-Dieu* district, to visualize, interact and mediate about revegetation data.
- [Geonum Project](fr/geonum_20/Projet_Geonum_20)(French only content) :
  Gathering and selection of urban data layers and proposition of indicators relevant to the prospection of revegetable areas.
  This work has been done by students of the UDL Geonum Master's degree.
- [LabXP Projet](fr/labxp_20/Projet_Labxp_20)(French only content) :
  Serious game prototype about urban vegetation management considering primary resources, maintenance costs and environmental parameters.
  This work has been done by GAMAGORA students.
- [Dashboard](https://github.com/urbanlab/datagora_dashboard) (GitHub repository) :
  Retrieval of online data, processing into statistical indicators and presentation as a modular dashboard, including raw data but also graphics.
  This work has been done by students of the *Ecole Centrale de Lyon*.
  which can include graphic elements in addition to the display of raw data.
- Canopée Remix :
  8 prototype projects of collective action, awareness raising and teaching, or management and maintenance of urban vegetation.
  This work has been done by mote than 100 participants during an event organised by the metropolis of Lyon from 10 to 13 November 2020.
- The Anthropocene Week 2021 :
  Event organised for the past two years by the Lyon Urban School.
  It brings together participants with very different profiles around different activities (round tables, workshops, exhibitions, etc.) regarding the impact of man on his environment.
- [VegetaLyon](fr/vegetalyon/VegetaLyon)(French only content) :
  Proposition of indicators relevant to the prospection of revegetable areas.
  This work has been done by students of the *École Centrale de Nantes*.

### Directions and landmarks within a digital urban environment
With internet and digital twins, free access is granted to digital reproductions of urban environments.
Moreover, with the global lockdowns and restrictions imposed by the COVID pandemy, the easiest if not the only way to travel and discover new places was to visit digitally.
How do people find their path in digital urban mockups?
How to direct people in the real world versus in a digital reproduction?
What are the representative elements (landmarks) of the real world that need to be reproduced to support directions?

A running project (codename *GUIDE*) studies this problematic on the specific case of the campus of Bron, known to be a complex environment with multiple traversals throughout buildings and vertical extension.
This project is a collaboration between researchers and engineers in linguistics and computer science.
It is composed of multiple parts:
- A study of spatial landmarks and linguistic directions observed on the real campus of Bron.
- Elaboration of hypotheses about representative elements.
- The development of a digital mockup of the campus of Bron.
- An observation of spatial landmarks and linguistic directions observed on the digital mockup to [in-]validate hypotheses (hypothetico-deductive method).
