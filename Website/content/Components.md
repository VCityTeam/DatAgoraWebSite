## Physical components
We propose a variety of stations to help fullfil the needs we encountered during our projects. We have developped them with our partners and documented them to provide both use and replication instructions.

### Model Display 
![erasme-imu](PartDieuModel/erasme-imu.png)

The technical device is made up of several elements, starting with the table in its centre on which the model is placed. It is surrounded by an iron frame to which the various elements are attached to enrich its use: 
* a video projector
* a camera
* a display screen
* a control screen
* light projectors

### Screenwall
