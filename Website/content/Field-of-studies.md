DatAgora's missions can be very different, with diversified approaches and the participation of many partners. As data is now a crucial component of many fields of study, we have to take interest in many subjects.

* [Game mediation and public space](Game-mediation-and-public-space) : Archive of all sensitive projects of interest for the design of an augmented model. Each of these projects can bring new technologies or innovative concepts to help visualise and interact with city information.
* [Analysis of urban mobility flows](Analysis-of-urban-mobility-flows) : Here are listed research and projects that study mobility flows in urban environments, whether for people, vehicles or goods.
* [Search in a documentary corpora](Search-in-documentary-corpora) : Reflection on the geolocation of data from documentary corpuses or even social networks.
* [Observation of the human interactions](Observations-of-the-exchanges) : This use case treats the DatAgora spaces as a place for reflection on the science of teams. Whatever the data analysed and visualised by the researchers, their group work would benefit from being facilitated.
