## Introduction
Within the framework of DatAgora we archive all sensitive projects of interest for the design of an augmented model. Each of these projects can bring new technologies or innovative concepts to help visualize and interact with city information. Using these and our own new tools, we aim to build a modular set of code that can be accessed and used freely by anyone who wishes to use and display and manipulate urban data. These are categorized to facilitate the search for those that may be interested in this project.

Our focus is the use of a model that will serve as a tangible way to display and interact with information as a group. This setup should help display and analyze problems encountered by various locations and openly discuss solutions with others. It can also be viewed as a way to showcase new or existing urbanization measures or issues to an audience, and gain knowledge regarding its city. We consider interaction to be at the core of this experience, whether it’s used solely to roam the city and highlight data or as a way to display the consequences of a change in the environment.

## State of the art projects
- [Experimental models](Experimental-models) : Model for physical experiments
- [White models](White-models) : Model combining physical model and projection
- [Augmented Models](Augmented-models) : Model coupling virtual visualization and augmented reality 
- [Hybridation](Hybridation) : Crossing of the three previous models 
- [Wide Screen](WideScreen) : Interaction with 2D Screen
 
## Previous experimentations
Several experimentations have been done around the MAM project : [Mediation and Augmented Mock-up](https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/workshop-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/)

In the last two years, workshops have been organized in collaboration with the IMU LabEx, the Erasme Urban Lab and the Lyon Urban School). 
- [Workshop in 2019]( https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/workshop-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/) : The objective of this workshop was to bring together students to reflect on the development of participatory use scenarios on public policy issues based on a 4D model (3D + time) of open data visualization of territorial data of "Grand Lyon".
- [Workshop in 2020]( https://imu.universite-lyon.fr/formation/retour-sur-latelier-usages-participatifs-et-maquette-augmentee/) : The objective was to reflect collaboratively on the way in which an architectural project (in this case, that of the Learning Center programmed on the Porte des Alpes Campus of the University Lumière Lyon 2 in Bron) fits into a territory, and to propose a concrete representation of this issue, a representation that had to be based on a model of the building and its enrichments: by territorial data sets, historical documents, etc. 
- [Vegetalization Project](Vegetalization-Project) : This project consists in developping a 3D model of Part-Dieu, one of the most important area of Lyon, in order to interact with data and mediate about the revegetation of the city. To do so, several devices will surround the model to help display, analyze and interact with urban data. We are closely collaborating with [Erasme](https://www.erasme.org/) to carry this project out.
