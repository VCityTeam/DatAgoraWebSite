## Introduction
Within the framework of DatAgora we archive all sensitive projects of interest for the design of an augmented model. Each of these projects can bring new technologies or innovative concepts to help visualize and interact with city information. Using these and our own new tools, we aim to build a modular set of code that can be accessed and used freely by anyone who wishes to use and display and manipulate urban data. These are categorized to facilitate the search for those that may be interested in this project.

Our focus is the use of a model that will serve as a tangible way to display and interact with information as a group. This setup should help display and analyze problems encountered by various locations and openly discuss solutions with others. It can also be viewed as a way to showcase new or existing urbanization measures or issues to an audience, and gain knowledge regarding its city. We consider interaction to be at the core of this experience, whether itâ€™s used solely to roam the city and highlight data or as a way to display the consequences of a change in the environment.

## State of the art projects
- [Experimental models](Experimental-models) : Model for physical experiments
- [White models](White-models) : Model combining physical model and projection
- [Augmented Models](Augmented-models) : Model coupling virtual visualization and augmented reality 
- [Hybridation](Hybridation) : Crossing of the three previous models 
- [Wide Screen](WideScreen) : Interaction with 2D Screen
