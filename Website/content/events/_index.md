## 2021
- **January** [The Anthropocene Week 2021](events-2021_AnthropoceneWeek) <br> The Anthropocene Week is an event organised for the past two years by the Lyon Urban School, which brings together participants with very different profiles around different activities (round tables, workshops, exhibitions, etc.) regarding the impact of man on his environment.

## 2020
- **January** [Restitution Atelier *Usages participatifs et maquette augmentée*](events-2020_Mockup) <br>The objective was to reflect collaboratively on the way in which an architectural project (in this case, that of the Learning Center programmed on the Porte des Alpes Campus of the University Lumière Lyon 2 in Bron) fits into a territory, and to propose a concrete representation of this issue, a representation that had to be based on a model of the building and its enrichments: by territorial data sets, historical documents, etc.

## 2019
- **January** : [Workshop *Usages participatifs et maquette augmentée*](events-2019_Workshop) <br>The objective of this workshop was to bring together students to reflect on the development of participatory use scenarios on public policy issues based on a 4D model (3D + time) of open data visualization of territorial data of "Grand Lyon".
