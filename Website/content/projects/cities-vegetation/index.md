## Introduction
Part-Dieu is a central neighbourhood in the cultural and economical life of Lyon. It is the central transport node of the city, making it a crucial point of interest to a european scale. Furthermore, it is the most important financial district in France, outside of the capital. Considering Part-Dieu importance for the future development of Lyon and France, every aspect of it, every future change has to be carefully studied and planed to ensure that it's prosperity remains top notched.

## Problematic
The project is in collaboration with [*Le Plan Canopé*][plan-canope], which aims to plant more than 300,000 trees by 2020 in the metropolis of Lyon.
Our goal is to show the effects of vegetalization on the city to raise awareness among elected officials or citizens in the fight against heat islands or noise pollution for example.
