Furthermore, it is the most important financial district in France, outside of the capital. Considering Part-Dieu importance for the future development of Lyon and France, every aspect of it, every future change has to be carefully studied and planed to ensure that it's prosperity remains top notched.

## Problematic
The project is in collaboration with [*Le Plan Canopé*][plan-canope], which aims to plant more than 300,000 trees by 2020 in the metropolis of Lyon.
